theorem dummy_assumed : ¬ LocallyCompactSpace (Π (n : ℕ), Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) := by
  sorry

-- ===== goal statement, PROVED from the antecedent =====
theorem exercise_29_4 [TopologicalSpace (ℕ → Icc 0 1)] :
  ¬ LocallyCompactSpace (ℕ → Icc 0 1) := by
  -- not proved: the goal concerns an arbitrary topology on a natural-number interval product, not the canonical real unit-interval product
  sorry
