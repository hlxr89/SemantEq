theorem dummy_assumed {R : Type*} [CommRing R] {p : R[X]} : (∃ q : R[X], q ≠ 0 ∧ p * q = 0) ↔ ∃ b : R, b ≠ 0 ∧ b • p = 0 := by
  sorry

-- ===== goal statement, PROVED from the antecedent =====
theorem exercise_7_2_2 {R : Type*} [Ring R] (p : Polynomial R) :
  p ∣ 0 ↔ ∃ b : R, b ≠ 0 ∧ b • p = 0 := by
  -- not proved: the candidate only concerns commutative rings and cannot imply this false statement for arbitrary rings (already false for R = ℤ and p = 1)
  sorry
