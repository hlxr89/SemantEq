theorem dummy_assumed {α : Type*} [LinearOrder α] [TopologicalSpace α] [OrderTopology α] : RegularSpace α := by
  sorry

-- ===== goal statement, PROVED from the antecedent =====
theorem exercise_31_3 {α : Type*} [PartialOrder α]

  -- not proved: the antecedent applies only to linear orders, while the goal allows arbitrary partial orders
  sorry
