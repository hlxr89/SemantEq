theorem exercise_11_13_3_assumed (N : ℕ):
  ∃ p ≥ N, Nat.Prime p ∧ p + 1 ≡ 0 [MOD 4] := by
  sorry

-- ===== goal statement, PROVED from the antecedent =====
theorem dummy : ∃ᶠ (p : ℕ) in atTop, p.Prime ∧ p % 4 = 3 := by
  -- not proved: `atTop` is an auto-implicit arbitrary filter, so the claim fails for `⊥`
  sorry
